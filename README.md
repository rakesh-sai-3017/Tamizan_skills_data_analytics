# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to estimate future sales based on past performance. This project uses a simple yet effective linear regression model to forecast future sales using historical sales data.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a regression model to predict future revenue based on historical sales data using Python and visualize the predictions.

---

## 📂 Dataset
A CSV file containing:
- `Date`: Transaction date
- `Product`: Product name
- `Quantity`: Number of units sold
- `Revenue`: Total revenue for the transaction

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Aggregating data monthly

2. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression using Scikit-learn

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score

4. **Forecasting & Visualization**
   - Plot actual vs predicted sales
   - Tabular view of forecast

## 📊 Output

- 📅 Monthly Sales Forecast
- 📈 Line Plot: Actual vs Predicted Revenue
- 📋 Tabular Forecast Data


## 💡 Future Scope
- Include seasonality and holiday effects
- Use advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM)
- Build a Power BI Dashboard for business visualization
